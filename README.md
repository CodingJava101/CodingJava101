### My Bio
#### Introduction
Hello, I am a computer programmer and a game developer. Back in high school, I've done a few coding competitions and exams and did quite well on them. My preferred language is Java but I can code in C#, HTML, Python and Javascript. Currently an university student trying to balance personal projects with homework.

My DMs on discord are open if you want to contact me. If you know me, you should know my discord. 

I also like anything tech related including video editing and fixing computer issues for friends and teachers. 

In Unity, I specialize in backend but I can also create many of the frontend features. By backend, I mean implementing authentication, save data, multiplayer, and others. I also do the User Interface and oversee the core features. 

#### My projects
- Video games with unity
  - School Projects that recreate and modify arcade games like Pong, Asteroids, Angry Birds etc.
  - Many attempts at creating a commercial games but lack of artists makes it difficult.
  - Currently making a large scale multiplayer co-op game with several people. Right now, I have done about 80% of the work but hoping to get more people in that project to reduce it. DM me if you want in! The game is called Death Kitchen, and you can find the Steam page for it below. PLEASE WISHLIST THE GAME NOW! Wishlists really matter when it comes to the visibility of the game, I would really appreciate it if you could wishlist Death Kitchen and follow our social media channels. Join the discord as well!
- Discord bot
  - Assignment/homework tracking, attendance tracking, and everything to manage a club all in one bot.
  - More small bots for other servers.

I also have a website! Here's my [about me](https://codingjava.gamedevelopment.ca/aboutMe.html) and [home](https://gamedevelopment.ca/) page. Yes, I do own the website, looking forward to what I can do with a cool domain name.
